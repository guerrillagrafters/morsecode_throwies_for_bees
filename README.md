# morsecode_throwies_for_bees
This project builds off of the original throwie by Graffiti Research Labs (www.graffitiresearchlab.com), and the subsequent development of the morse code throwie using the ATTINY (http://www.instructables.com/id/Throwduino-Basic-Light-Sensing-Flashing-Throwie-/). A lot more work could be done to make this code lighter. We welcome development!
